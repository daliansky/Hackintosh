/*! @class IOService
    @abstract The base class for most I/O Kit families, devices, and drivers.
    @discussion The IOService base class defines APIs used to publish services, instantiate other services based on the existance of a providing service (ie. driver stacking), destroy a service and its dependent stack, notify interested parties of service state changes, and general utility functions useful across all families. 

Types of service are specified with a matching dictionary that describes properties of the service. For example, a matching dictionary might describe any IOUSBDevice (or subclass), an IOUSBDevice with a certain class code, or a IOPCIDevice with a set of matching names or device & vendor IDs. Since the matching dictionary is interpreted by the family which created the service, as well as generically by IOService, the list of properties considered for matching depends on the familiy.

Matching dictionaries are associated with IOService classes by the catalogue, as driver property tables, and also supplied by clients of the notification APIs.

IOService provides matching based on C++ class (via OSMetaClass dynamic casting), registry entry name, a registry path to the service (which includes device tree paths), a name assigned by BSD, or by its location (its point of attachment).

<br><br>Driver Instantiation by IOService<br><br>

Drivers are subclasses of IOService, and their availability is managed through the catalogue. They are instantiated based on the publication of an IOService they use (for example, an IOPCIDevice or IOUSBDevice), or when they are added to  the catalogue and the IOService(s) they use are already available.

When an IOService (the "provider") is published with the @link registerService registerService@/link method, the matching and probing process begins, which is always single threaded per provider. A list of matching dictionaries from the catalog and installed publish notification requests, that successfully match the IOService, is constructed, with ordering supplied by <code>kIOProbeScoreKey</code> ("IOProbeScore") property in the dictionary, or supplied with the notification. 

Each entry in the list is then processed in order - for notifications, the notification is delivered, for driver property tables a lot more happens.

The driver class is instantiated and <code>init()</code> called with its property table. The new driver instance is then attached to the provider, and has its @link probe probe@/link method called with the provider as an argument. The default <code>probe</code> method does nothing but return success, but a driver may implement this method to interrogate the provider to make sure it can work with it. It may also modify its probe score at this time. After probe, the driver is detached and the next in the list is considered (ie. attached, probed, and detached).

When the probing phase is complete, the list consists of successfully probed drivers, in order of their probe score (after adjustment during the @link probe probe@/link call). The list is then divided into categories based on the <code>kIOMatchCategoryKey</code> property ("IOMatchCategory"); drivers without a match category are all considered in one default category. Match categories allow multiple clients of a provider to be attached and started, though the provider may also enforce open/close semantics to gain active access to it.

For each category, the highest scoring driver in that category is attached to the provider, and its @link start start@/link method called. If <code>start</code> is successful, the rest of the drivers in the same match category are discarded, otherwise the next highest scoring driver is started, and so on.

The driver should only consider itself in action when the start method is called, meaning it has been selected for use on the provider, and consuming that particular match category. It should also be prepared to be allocated, probed and freed even if the probe was successful.

After the drivers have all synchronously been started, the installed "matched" notifications that match the registered IOService are delivered.

<br><br>Properties used by IOService<br><br>

	<code>kIOClassKey, extern const OSSymbol * gIOClassKey, "IOClass"</code>
<br>
<br>
Class of the driver to instantiate on matching providers.
<br>
<br>
	<code>kIOProviderClassKey, extern const OSSymbol * gIOProviderClassKey, "IOProviderClass"</code>
<br>
<br>
Class of the provider(s) to be considered for matching, checked with OSDynamicCast so subclasses will also match.
<br>
<br>
	<code>kIOProbeScoreKey, extern const OSSymbol * gIOProbeScoreKey, "IOProbeScore"</code>
<br>
<br>
The probe score initially used to order multiple matching drivers.
<br>
<br>
	<code>kIOMatchCategoryKey, extern const OSSymbol * gIOMatchCategoryKey, "IOMatchCategory"</code>
<br>
<br>
A string defining the driver category for matching purposes. All drivers with no <code>IOMatchCategory</code> property are considered to be in the same default category. Only one driver in a category can be started on each provider.
<br>
<br>
	<code>kIONameMatchKey, extern const OSSymbol * gIONameMatchKey, "IONameMatch"</code>
<br>
A string or collection of strings that match the provider's name. The comparison is implemented with the @link //apple_ref/cpp/instm/IORegistryEntry/compareNames/virtualbool/(OSObject*,OSString**) IORegistryEntry::compareNames@/link method, which supports a single string, or any collection (OSArray, OSSet, OSDictionary etc.) of strings. IOService objects with device tree properties (eg. IOPCIDevice) will also be matched based on that standard's "compatible", "name", "device_type" properties. The matching name will be left in the driver's property table in the <code>kIONameMatchedKey</code> property.
<br>
Examples
<pre>
@textblock
	<key>IONameMatch</key>
	<string>pci106b,7</string>
@/textblock
</pre>

For a list of possible matching names, a serialized array of strings should used, eg.
<pre>
@textblock
	<key>IONameMatch</key>
	<array>
		<string>APPL,happy16</string>
		<string>pci106b,7</string>
	</array>
@/textblock
</pre>

<br>
	<code>kIONameMatchedKey, extern const OSSymbol * gIONameMatchedKey, "IONameMatched"</code>
<br>
The name successfully matched name from the <code>kIONameMatchKey</code> property will be left in the driver's property table as the <code>kIONameMatchedKey</code> property.
<br>
<br>
	<code>kIOPropertyMatchKey, extern const OSSymbol * gIOPropertyMatchKey, "IOPropertyMatch"</code>
<br>
A dictionary of properties that each must exist in the matching IOService and compare successfully with the <code>isEqualTo</code> method.

<pre>
@textblock
	<key>IOPropertyMatch</key>
	<dictionary>
		<key>APPL,happy16</key>
		<string>APPL,meek8</string>
	</dictionary>
@/textblock
</pre>

<br>
	<code>kIOUserClientClassKey, extern const OSSymbol * gIOUserClientClassKey, "IOUserClientClass"</code>
<br>
The class name that the service will attempt to allocate when a user client connection is requested.  First the device nub is queried, then the nub's provider is queried by default.
<br>
<br>
	<code>kIOKitDebugKey, extern const OSSymbol * gIOKitDebugKey, "IOKitDebug"</code>
<br>
Set some debug flags for logging the driver loading process. Flags are defined in <code>IOKit/IOKitDebug.h</code>, but <code>65535</code> works well.*/

Each client has its @link stop stop@/link method called upon their close of an inactive IOService object , or on its termination if they do not have it open. After <code>stop</code>, @link detach detach@/link is called in each client. When all clients have been detached, the @link finalize finalize@/link method is called in the inactive service.

    @abstract Informs power management when a power-managed device is in use, so that power management can track when it is idle and adjust its power state accordingly.
    @discussion The <code>activityTickle</code> method is provided for objects in the system (or for the driver itself) to tell a driver that its device is being used.
    The IOService superclass can manage idleness determination with a simple idle timer mechanism and this <code>activityTickle</code> call. To start this up, the driver calls its superclass's <code>setIdleTimerPeriod</code>. This starts a timer for the time interval specified in the call. When the timer expires, the superclass checks to see if there has been any activity since the last timer expiration. (It checks to see if <code>activityTickle</code> has been called). If there has been activity, it restarts the timer, and this process continues. When the timer expires, and there has been no device activity, the superclass lowers the device power state to the next lower state. This can continue until the device is in state zero.
    After the device has been powered down by at least one power state, a subsequent call to <code>activityTickle</code> causes the device to be switched to a higher state required for the activity.    
    If the driver is managing the idleness determination totally on its own, the value of the <code>type</code> parameter should be <code>kIOPMSubclassPolicy</code>, and the driver should override the <code>activityTickle</code> method. The superclass IOService implementation of <code>activityTickle</code> does nothing with the <code>kIOPMSubclassPolicy</code> argument.
    @param type When <code>type</code> is <code>kIOPMSubclassPolicy</code>, <code>activityTickle</code> is not handled in IOService and should be intercepted by the subclass. When <code>type</code> is <code>kIOPMSuperclassPolicy1</code>, an activity flag is set and the device state is checked. If the device has been powered down, it is powered up again.
    @param stateNumber When <code>type</code> is <code>kIOPMSuperclassPolicy1</code>, <code>stateNumber</code> contains the desired power state ordinal for the activity. If the device is in a lower state, the superclass will switch it to this state. This is for devices that can handle some accesses in lower power states; the device is powered up only as far as it needs to be for the activity.
    @result When <code>type</code> is <code>kIOPMSuperclassPolicy1</code>, the superclass returns <code>true</code> if the device is currently in the state specified by <code>stateNumber</code>. If the device is in a lower state and must be powered up, the superclass returns <code>false</code>; in this case the superclass will initiate a power change to power the device up. */
